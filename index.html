            <h1>The Taxonomies of Visual Cognition</h1>
            <p>Building a data visualizaton requires consideration of audience perception through a variety of lenses. 
                Visual cognition involves the intellectual functions involved in perceiving and 
                processing information through visual modality. It  is an important pillar of 
                information design as it provides us with a framework for how an audience considers and identifies patterns 
                within quantitative and qualitative data. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The study of visual cognition has produced various taxonomies that provide a framework for 
                design work to appeal to the visual system and facilitate easier and more accurate extraction 
                of information. While these taxonomies are not strict laws, but rather considerations in building 
                a data visualization,  the interplay of these various guidelines provide guidelines for mapping 
                information to visual form.

                Consider a data visualization  such as the one to the right depicting the time commitment required of four courses over one semester in comparison to the courseâ€™s number of assignments.  In deisgning each glyph of this graphical form, the taxonomies of visual cognition were considered in aiding the audience in quickly and accurately ecognizing relationships, correlations, and comparisons.
